# Solution Document — Automating the Valuation Package Process

**Product:** MOA Valuation Package Automation  
**Audience:** delivery, architecture review, and client handover  
**Updated:** 5 October 2026  
**Requirements:** the requirements document (MOA Val Package Assembly and 401(k) Editing/Review), including the updated instructions and the assembly-log column sheet

The requirements document describes the **manual** process a reviewer follows in Adobe and Excel. This application automates that process on the reviewer’s computer. This document maps each manual step to what the application does, and states what the reviewer still does by hand.

---

## 1. The problem (manual process)

A reviewer assembles a Mutual of America Valuation Package for a plan year by hand:

1. Claim the plan on the Testing Log by entering their name, so others know it is being worked. That shared workbook is separate from the Val Assembly Log written after the package is finished.
2. Open the plan folder on `K:\Mutual of America\<Plan Number>\Testing\…\Valuation Package`.
3. Confirm every source file is a PDF. If it is not, convert it or send it back to the tester.
4. In Adobe, choose Combine Files, add every PDF, drag files into the required order, and remove pages that should not ship. Location files stay together (Contribution Analysis Loc 1, then Loc 2).
5. Combine into one PDF. Move individual pages with thumbnails if needed, including the inner order of ADP/ACP, 410(b), and a component Average Benefit Percentage test.
6. Save as `{PlanNumber}_{BeginningPlanYear}-Valuation.pdf` in the Testing folder. The year is the **start** of the plan year (for example 10/01/2017–09/30/2018 is 2017).
7. Review the package against the requirements:
   - Cover must show the Mutual of America stamp, and company, address, plan name, and plan year end must match the plan. The cover letter date must be today’s date.
   - Keep or remove Action Required paragraphs (compliance failure, PRIOR vs CURRENT ADP/ACP, after 12 months, variance, top heavy at 60% or more, “no immediate action”).
   - Keep or remove ADP/ACP failure notices and type the QNEC and refund amounts from the correction page. If only ADP or only ACP failed, drop the unused QNEC line.
   - Remove 415 failure information and the 415 sample letter if the plan did not fail 415.
   - Remove ADP/ACP and 402(g) sample letters when returns are not required (including 402(g) not processed by 15 April).
   - Keep Excess Summary only for non-ADP/ACP failures, or an ADP/ACP failure for a partially vested participant.
   - Keep or remove Year End Recap / Important Information bullets from the testing method, HCE, Safe Harbor, top heavy, and match rules.
   - Leave the BRF result on the Result Summary. Do not include a BRF report.
   - Do not include audited wording, Statement of Contribution, 5500 wording, or escalation wording.
   - Include the three Compliance and Administrative Report pages.
   - Check the Result Summary against the test reports, and check the client variance copy.
   - Add bookmarks with the required titles (HCE vs HCE/Key, ADP Test vs ACP Test vs ADP/ACP Tests). Variance is not bookmarked.
8. Email the tester. The subject must start with MOA, then plan number, plan name, and plan year end.
9. Update the Val Assembly Log in the client column sheet: plan number, plan name, future and current HCE, allocation, pass/fail, and top heavy. FIS, related plans, MEP, and safe harbor are filled by the tester.

That work is slow, easy to order wrong, and easy to leave the wrong paragraph in the package.

## 2. The solution

The application runs on the reviewer’s PC. The reviewer uploads the Valuation Package PDFs (or pastes the folder path) and, when they have it, the valuation package log Excel. The application combines the PDFs, applies the keep/remove rules, fills amounts, adds bookmarks, runs the package checks, and writes the named PDF, an email draft, and a log row in the client columns. If the reviewer checks **Retype cover date to today, 402(g) dates, and HCE %**, it also sets the cover letter date to today, rewrites the prior-year HCE percentage, and rewrites off-calendar 402(g) dates.

The reviewer then checks the result, sends the email, and finishes any step the application does not own (listed in §4).

```
Manual today                         Application
────────────────────────             ────────────────────────────────
Adobe Combine + drag order    →      Upload or folder path, auto-order,
                                     including Loc 1 then Loc 2
Delete unneeded pages         →      Keep/remove rules edit the PDF.
                                     BRF report and disallowed wording
                                     are removed
Type QNEC and refund amounts  →      Amounts filled from the profile
Add bookmarks by hand         →      Bookmarks written from remaining
                                     sections. BRF is not bookmarked
Save ######_YYYY-Valuation    →      Same filename, beginning plan year
Write the email               →      Outlook draft (.eml), reviewer sends it
Update the assembly log       →      One row in the client columns
Cover date, HCE %, 402(g)     →      Optional. Off unless “Retype cover
dates on the pages                   date to today, 402(g) dates, and
                                     HCE %” is checked
```

## 3. Manual step → what the application does

| Manual step in the requirements | What the application does |
|---|---|
| Open the Valuation Package folder and add the PDFs | Upload files, or paste the folder path. The application reads PDFs and the valuation package log Excel from that path. |
| Put reports in the required order | Auto-order matches filenames to section keywords (for example Valuation Pkg, ResultSumm, HCEKey, ADP, 402, Census). Location files stay with that report, Loc 1 before Loc 2. The reviewer can still move rows Up/Down or Remove. |
| Inner page order | Pages whose headings match are reordered: ADP/ACP as Summary, Detail, Excluded, Corrections; 410(b) as Detail, Excludable, Includable, Summary; a component Average Benefit Percentage test as Average Benefit Percentage, 401a1 Comp, Gateway, Overall Comp, Rate Group, then Sum Comp. |
| A multi-page cover / package that holds several front sections | A multi-page cover is split into separate rows named Cover Letter, Action required page 1–3, the excess notices, the failure letters, Year End Recap, and Compliance Report 1–3, so those pages can be reordered. |
| Remove files or pages that do not belong | Rules decide keep or remove for Action Required, notices, sample letters, Excess Summary, and recap bullets. A BRF report is left out. Audited wording, Statement of Contribution, 5500 wording, and escalation wording are removed. |
| Cover: Mutual of America stamp; company, address, plan name, plan year end | Extracted into a Plan Profile and shown on the Checks tab, including the upper-right stamp. |
| Cover letter date is today | Optional. When the reviewer checks **Retype cover date to today, 402(g) dates, and HCE %**, the cover letter date is set to today. The Checks tab flags a date that is not today. The box is off by default. |
| Result Summary matches the test reports | The Checks tab compares top-heavy percent (including 0.00% and Plan is / is not Top Heavy) and pass/fail for 410(b), 401(a)(4), 414(s), 402(g), 415, ADP, and ACP. A failed 410(b) also looks for the Average Benefit Percentage wording. |
| Action Required paragraphs (failure, PRIOR, CURRENT, after 12 months, variance, top heavy, no action) | Kept or removed from the Plan Profile (testing method, returns, ADP/ACP, 402(g), 415, top heavy ≥ 60%, variance, contributions). PRIOR / CURRENT, future HCE, current HCE, and the allocation answer are read from the valuation package log Excel when that file is uploaded. |
| Compensation Limit Failure Summary has no special Action Required wording | The file can be included in order. The application does not add a special Action Required paragraph for it. On the assembly log, Failed Comp Limit is always N/A. |
| CURRENT ADP/ACP notice: type total QNEC, ADP QNEC, ACP QNEC | Placeholders are filled. If only ADP or only ACP has a QNEC, the other line is removed. |
| After 12 months CURRENT: QNEC plus deferral and match refunds | Filled when those amounts are present. A missing amount drops that line. |
| After 12 months PRIOR: refunds only, no QNEC sentence | Refund lines are filled. PRIOR does not keep the within-12 CURRENT notice. |
| 415 failure information and 415 letter | Removed when the plan did not fail 415. |
| ADP and ACP sample letters | Each letter stays only if that test failed and returns are required. |
| 402(g) sample letter | Removed if there are no 402(g) returns, or the report notes the failure was not processed by 15 April. |
| Excess Summary | Kept for 402(g) or 415, or for ADP/ACP when a participant is partially vested. Plan number, plan name, and plan year end on the excess notice are checked. |
| Client variance copy | Checked for plan number, plan name, plan year end, Social Security numbers, zeroes shown as 0.00, one font size, names in Last, First order, and text at the page edge. The application flags problems. It does not retype the variance page. |
| Year End Recap bullets | Kept or removed from HCE, PRIOR/CURRENT, Safe Harbor, top heavy, catch-up, and per-payroll match. |
| BRF | The Result Summary line can remain. A BRF report file or page is left out and is not bookmarked. |
| Compliance reports | Included when the file is in the package. The Checks tab expects three Compliance and Administrative Report pages and flags a different count. Missing pages are not created. |
| Plan identity on each report | Plan number and plan name are checked on each report page. |
| Bookmarks | Created for sections that remain, with the required titles, including HCE for 403(b) and ADP Test / ACP Test / ADP/ACP Tests. BRF and the variance report are not bookmarked. |
| Save `{PlanNumber}_{BeginningPlanYear}-Valuation.pdf` | Same name. Off-calendar plans use the beginning year from the cover. If the source path is a Valuation Package folder, a copy is also written to the Testing folder when that path can be written. |
| Email the tester | An Outlook draft is written. Subject starts with MOA, then plan number, plan name, and plan year end. The reviewer sends it. |
| Update the Val Assembly Log | A row is appended in the client columns. Plan number and plan name come from the Result Summary. Future HCE and current-year HCE are Yes or No. Allocation is Variance, Annual, or Annual-Var. A true-up with no variance is Variance, with a cell note of 0.00 variance. ADP/ACP, 402(g), 410(b), ABP, 414(s), 401(a)(4), 415, and BRF are P, F, or N/A. Either ADP or ACP failing is F. A test the plan does not have is N/A. Top Heavy is Yes or No. Failed Comp Limit is N/A. FIS, related plans, MEP, and safe harbor are left blank for the tester. |
| Prior-year HCE percentage | Optional, same retype checkbox. Calculated only when the testing method is PRIOR and an NHCE % is on the package: under 2% → ×2; 2% to 7.99% → +2; 8% or more → ×1.25. A CURRENT plan is left as printed. |
| 402(g) dates on an off-calendar plan | Optional, same checkbox. An off-calendar plan year is rewritten to the calendar year before the plan year end, and only on a page that contains 402(g). A calendar plan (year ending 31 December) is left as printed. The saved filename still uses the beginning plan year from the cover. |
| See what was rewritten | Preview has **Highlight changes**, on by default. Yellow marks sit on the rewritten words. Uncheck it for a plain preview. The downloaded PDF never includes the marks. |

---

## 4. What the reviewer still does

These steps stay manual because they are outside the PDF package, or they are a visual check the rules do not finish.

| Manual step | Why it stays manual |
|---|---|
| Enter your name on the Testing Log to claim the plan | This is the shared testing workbook (for example the 2023 testing log and the off-calendar testing log, on the assembly tab). The application does not open those workbooks, does not know which year’s file or which row to update, and does not have the reviewer’s name. The Val Assembly Log written at the end is a different file and does not claim the plan. |
| Convert a non-PDF to PDF, or send it back to the tester | Non-PDF files are skipped with a warning. A scanned PDF that is only a picture cannot be read, so rules, bookmarks, the filename, and the log stay empty. |
| Confirm no other company name appears besides Mutual of America | The stamp check is automated. Other names on the cover are still a visual check. |
| Send the email | The application prepares the draft. The reviewer sends it. |
| Fill FIS, related plans, MEP, and safe harbor on the assembly log | Those columns are left blank because the client sheet says the tester updates them. |
| Retype a client variance page that fails the check | The Checks tab reports name order, font size, zeroes, and cut-off text. It does not rebuild that page. |

The cover date, the prior-year HCE %, and off-calendar 402(g) dates are rewritten only when the reviewer checks **Retype cover date to today, 402(g) dates, and HCE %**. The box is off by default so a normal run does not move text on the page. If the package has no matching date or percentage, those lines stay as printed and the result notes say so.

---

## 5. How the application is built

The reviewer uses a browser on the same PC. There is no separate server and no database.

```
Browser (upload, order, preview, checks)
        │
        ▼
Application API  (http://127.0.0.1:8002)
        │
        ▼
Pipeline: order → merge PDFs → reorder inner pages
          → read plan facts (PDF + valuation log Excel)
          → apply rules → edit PDF → drop BRF report
          → remove disallowed wording
          → optional cover date, 402(g), and HCE retype
          → checks → bookmarks
          → save PDF, email draft, assembly log
        │
        ▼
Files on disk (and optional K: Testing folder)
```

**Plan Profile** is the single set of facts every rule uses: plan number, names, dates, 401(k) vs 403(b), CURRENT vs PRIOR, pass/fail, QNEC and refund amounts, top heavy, HCE, allocation notes, and whether returns are required. Rules do not re-read the PDF to decide keep or remove. The assembly log and the Checks tab do read the finished pages so the Result Summary, variance copy, and log values can be compared with what was printed.

Rules and section order live in configuration (`rules`, paragraph headings, section order and filename keywords), so requirement wording can be adjusted without rewriting the pipeline.

**Outputs**

- `{PlanNumber}_{BeginningPlanYear}-Valuation.pdf`
- Outlook `.eml` draft beside that PDF
- `ValAssemblyLog.xlsx` under the output folder (`MOA_OUTPUT_DIR`, or the application output folder), using the client column sheet

**On a client PC:** Python is already installed. Run the application, open http://127.0.0.1:8002. The first run installs PDF and Excel libraries from the internet once. To copy the application without a zip, use the text installer `install_moa.py`, then `run.bat`.

## 6. Processing sequence

1. Reviewer selects PDFs and the valuation package log Excel, or a Valuation Package folder.
2. The application lists files in requirement order, keeps location files together, and splits a multi-page cover into named pages. A BRF report file is left off the list.
3. Reviewer confirms order (or moves rows). Optionally checks **Retype cover date to today, 402(g) dates, and HCE %**, then clicks Process.
4. PDFs are merged. Inner ADP/ACP, 410(b), and component benefit-test pages are reordered when their headings match. Excel and a compliance testing summary, if present, fill the Plan Profile. Summary overlays are not merged into the package as extra reports.
5. Keep/remove is applied, amounts are filled, empty pages are dropped, the BRF report and disallowed wording are removed, and SSNs are flagged if found. If the retype box was checked, the cover date is set to today, and the prior-year HCE % and off-calendar 402(g) dates are rewritten where the printed text matches.
6. Checks run for the cover date, the Result Summary, the three compliance pages, the client variance copy, and plan identity on the reports. Bookmarks are added.
7. The named PDF, email draft, and assembly-log row are written. The reviewer previews (with **Highlight changes** on or off) and downloads the clean PDF, then sends the draft and fills the tester columns on the log.

---

## 7. What to say in the review

The requirements document is the manual Adobe and Excel procedure. The application automates combine, order, inner-page order, keep/remove, amount fill, bookmarks, the package checks, the valuation filename, the email draft, and the assembly log in the client columns. When the reviewer checks **Retype cover date to today, 402(g) dates, and HCE %**, it also sets the cover letter date to today and rewrites the prior-year HCE percentage and off-calendar 402(g) dates. Preview can highlight those words. The downloaded file does not.

The reviewer still claims the plan on the Testing Log, sends the email, fills the tester columns on the assembly log, and checks any line the retype option left as printed.
